# CryptoQuest

This is a simple game inspired by CryptoZombies and EverQuest.

There is a fair amount of experimentation going on, but I've tried to keep the git log as clean as I am able.

## Learn from my Mistakes / Questions, etc.

I'm working my way through so many mistakes and questions as I try and bend my brain from my current comfort zone - web app development - to something entirely new.

You can following along by reading my git commits. I've tried to capture my thinking in my commit messages. I hope they make enough sense that you can learn something, too.
